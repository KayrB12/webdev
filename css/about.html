    <h1>San Luis Obispo Attractions</h1>
    <p>Some of my favorite attractions to visit here:</p>
    <h2>Hearst Castle</h2>
    <p>This stunningly detailed estate was designed by William Randolph Hearst and his architecht Julia Morgan, the first woman to become a licensed architect in California. 
        It has since become a historic landmark as the public can take tours through its many features. Tours range from exploring the gardens and both swimming pools to viewing the kitchen and bedrooms. 
        The estate also features three guest houses, Casa Del Mar, Casa Del Monte, and Casa Del Sol, as well as the main house Casa Grande </p>

    <h2 id="id">Madonna Inn</h2>
    <p> This hotel, created by Alex Madonna, is best known for its quirky design, both inside and out. Its exterior resembles a whimsical and fantastical style mixed with swiss architecture.
        Its many rooms each have a different theme and style, with such styles being, Bridal Falls, Caveman, Jungle Rock, Hearts and Flowers and many many more.

    <h2 class="class">Piedras Blancas Elephant Seal Rookery</h2> 
    <p>This marine reserve is located just offshore of San Luis Obispo County. Within its boundary, every species of marine animal is protected. Here visitors can watch these elephants seals on the beach for free.
         Elephant seals are typically visible on the beach year round, though numbers fluctuate each season.</p>
